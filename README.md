# Helmholtz-PINN
Physics-Informed Neural Network approach for solving the Helmholtz equation

This project explores the use of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** for solving the Helmholtz equation, 
which plays a central role in wave propagation problems in physics and engineering.

## Features
- PINN implementation with PyTorch
- Solves 1D/2D Helmholtz equation
- Incorporates boundary conditions directly into the loss function
- Comparison with classical numerical methods (FEM/FDM)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Helmholtz-PINN.git
cd Helmholtz-PINN
pip install -r requirements.txt
